# madjokes
MadJokes is a program that gives users a mashup of random jokes and punchlines that may or may not--mostly likely may not--illicit laughs. It's really a take on MadLibs where word substitues can create zany, nonsensical and often humorous stories.  

This is a program that grew out of a collaboration from Aaron Hall & Christian Arab as a way to use the javascript code learned via CodeCademy. So while the two would like MadJokes to to be funny, they are more satisfied with the simple fact that they can develop code that actually works. 

MadJokes is a continual work in pogress, as Aaron and Christian continue to incorporate their new coding skills to improve the site. 

Enjoy!
